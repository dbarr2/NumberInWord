# NumberInWord Class in Java

The `NumberInWord` class is designed to illustrate the basics of control flow in Java using conditional statements. This class features a single method that takes an integer parameter and prints the textual representation of numbers 1 through 9. For any number outside of this range, the method prints "OTHER". This exercise is an excellent starting point for understanding how to use switch-case statements or if-else blocks in Java.

## Overview

This Java class aims to convert numeric inputs into their corresponding word formats for the numbers one to nine. It is intended to provide a clear example of how to handle multiple conditions in a program. The method within the `NumberInWord` class showcases a fundamental programming concept in a concise and practical manner.

## Features

- **Simple Input Handling**: Accepts an integer as an input parameter.
- **Conditional Logic**: Uses a control flow mechanism to match the input number with its textual representation.
- **Range Checking**: Efficiently identifies numbers within the specified range (1-9) and handles those outside of it by printing "OTHER".

## Implementation

The class contains a method that examines the input parameter and prints the corresponding word for numbers 1 through 9. If the input number does not fall within this range, the method will print "OTHER". This functionality demonstrates basic conditional logic, making it an ideal example for those new to programming or Java.

## Usage

The `NumberInWord` class's method can be called with any integer value. Depending on the value passed, it will print the word corresponding to numbers 1-9 or "OTHER" if the number does not match any case within the specified range. This method is useful for applications or exercises where converting numeric values to words is required, or for any beginner project aimed at practicing control flow in Java.

## Conclusion

The `NumberInWord` class offers a straightforward approach to converting numbers to words in Java, highlighting the use of conditional statements. It provides an effective demonstration of handling various conditions and is suitable for beginners aiming to grasp the basics of Java programming concepts. This class not only serves as a practical coding exercise but also as a building block for more complex conditional logic applications.
